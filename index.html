        <p id="par">My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgable books in my free time.Whenever I go to home from school I like to read such books After completing my homework.I am 10 years old and I read in 6th standard.Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete.This can be developed by anyone , however I got this naturally.Reading books can make one happy and busy.It is the good source of enjoyment,knowledge,inspiration and instruction.It makes us disciplined,loyal,punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>
